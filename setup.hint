ldesc: "Quod Libet is a GTK+-based audio player written in Python. It's 
designed around the idea that you know how to organize your music better 
than we do. It lets you make playlists based on regular expressions 
(don't worry, regular searches work too). It lets you display and edit 
any tags you want in the file. And it lets you do this for all the file 
formats it supports -- Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Musepack, and MOD."
